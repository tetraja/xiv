<p>This is a random repository of general information and guides for Final Fantasy XIV. It is heavily under construction and updated somewhat sporadically at the moment, so isn't yet easy to navigate.</p>
<p>Why I started this site:</p>
<ul>
<li>Information is scattered all over, and I wanted to keep it in (mostly) one place</li>
<li>I wanted a site that wasn't cluttered (by unrelated objects), loaded quickly, and is easy to access and send to friends</li>
<li>I hate keeping information in Discord and other completely closed communities that can be deleted at any time</li>
</ul>
<p>If I included a guide you made and would rather not have included here, please <a href="https://github.com/tetraja/xiv/issues" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">open an issue<ExternalLinkIcon/></a> or contact me by <a href="tetraja.keeob@aleeas.com">email</a>.</p>
