(june 4, 2023) This section is WIP. I'm not yet sure how I want to break it up into pages, but I'll just put random things for right now

shortcuts & text commands
`<pos>` - outputs your current location and coordinates as a link in chat
`<t>` - outputs the name of your current target in chat. Also works with numbers (i.e. `<1>`, `<6>`) to target a party member in that position.
`<thpp>` - outputs the HP percentage of your current target in chat
`/isearch [TEXT]` - searches all inventories for items matching [TEXT]. Partial text matching works.

## Terminology

- MSQ - Main Story Quest. The main questline of the game's story.
- DF - Duty Finder. The function of the game that provides automatic party-matching for duties.
- PF - Party Finder. A menu in which players create their own party listings with content they wish to complete.
- MT/WC - Mistell/Wrong Chat. Shorthand apology for when you send a message in the wrong chat channel. Not to be confused with MT in duties.
- FC - Free Company. FFXIV's version of Guilds and other groups common to MMOs. They are player created and managed, and are purely a social feature.
- GC - Grand Company. FFXIV's version of Factions and other groups common to MMOs. They are mandatory to join early in MSQ and have a minor impact on gameplay (mainly aesthetic), but aren't permanent and can be swapped between after ranking up a few times.

Duty Related
- MT - Main Tank. Tank who beings the encounter and holds enmity for most or all of the encounter.
- OT - Off Tank. Tank who takes a supportive role and provides backup, handles additional enemies with/instead of MT, and/or swaps with the MT to handle debuffs. Typically only necessary in Extreme and higher content outside of add management.
- CD - Countdown. Usually initated with the slash command `/cd <SECONDS>`
- LB - Limit Break. A special action executable when the Limit Break bar (at the bottom of the screen by default) fills by at least one level.
