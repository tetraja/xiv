# Relic Tips

- You can't buy materials needed for later steps without reaching that step first, so stockpiling becomes easier once your first relic is completed.

| Relic       | Poetics | Company Seals | Allied Seals | Gil       | EW Tomes |
| :---------- | ------: | ------------: | -----------: | --------: | -------: |
| Zodiac      | 36,700  | 800,000       | 40,000       | 4,000,000 |          |
| Anima       | 211,250 | 1,820,000     | 78,000       |           |          |
| Resistance  | 17,000  |               |              |           |          |
| Manderville |         |               |              |           | 28,500   |
| **Total**   | **264,950** | **2,620,000** | **118,000** | **4,000,000** | **28,500** |

Notes:

- The Gil cost of the Zodiac weapons is only for the mandatory purchased items, not including other costs incurred by the market board
- Cost of the Crystal Sand step isn't included in the Anima total due to the many ways it can be acquired
- Eureka weapons only use currency earned inside the instances, thus aren't included.
- The EW tomes required for the Manderville relics will become Poetics upon the release of the next expansion.
