To unlock the achievements "Tool Time for the Hand" and "Tool Time for the Land", you only need to complete one tool for both a DoH class and DoL class for their respective achievements. The remaining tools can be purchased from a Calamity Salvager for 1,000 Gil each. Pick whichever you think sounds the funniest.

## Materials

- x2 Mastercraft Demimateria | 800 White Crafters' Scrips - Crafters' Scrip (Master Recpies/Materials/Misc.) -> White Scrip Exchange (Lv. 50 Materials)
