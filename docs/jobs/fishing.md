## FAQ

> Q: I can't tell when I've hooked a fish.

A: The tug exclamation points categorized as Battle Effects and not included in the simple setting. As sound effects for battle effects are tied to the effect, the "ping" sound effect will not play if the effect is turned off. Please set "Self" Battle Effects to all in the Character Configuration window, or by typing `/bfx self all` in chat. This noise will also not play if sound effects are muted.

Additionally, the Cast Light skill adds a light to the end of your fishing rod that will shake when you've hooked a fish. If using a controller, if vibration is turned on, the controller will vibrate when a fish is hooked.
