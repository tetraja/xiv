Created with [VuePress](https://v2.vuepress.vuejs.org/)
I'm a novice, so things are likely broken.

## index

This is random repository of general information and guides for Final Fantasy XIV.

Why I started this site:
- Information is scattered all over, and I wanted to keep it in (mostly) one place
- I wanted a site that wasn't cluttered, loaded quickly, and is easy to access and send to friends
- I hate keeping information in Discord and other completely closed communities that can be deleted at any time

If I included a guide you made and would rather not have included here, please [open an issue](https://github.com/tetraja/xiv/issues) or contact me by [email](tetraja.keeob@aleeas.com
).
